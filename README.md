# Romania-Forest-Ecosystem-Analysis-1990-2019-

📊 Project Overview
This data science project conducts an in-depth analysis of Romania's forest coverage, examining regional disparities, growth patterns, and conservation implications. The analysis provides evidence-based insights for environmental policy and sustainable forest management.

Technical Implementation
•	Used R for statistical computing and data analysis

•	Used dplyr for data manipulation and aggregation

•	Implemented ggplot2 for professional visualizations

•	Conducted ANOVA testing to validate regional differences

•	Developed exponential growth models: Projected = Current × (1 + CAGR)^years

Steps
1. Data Collection - I used an open data file from Kaggle
2. Data Processing - Handled NA values, cleaned columns
3. Exploratory Analysis - Regional comparisons, growth rate calculations
4. Statistical Testing - ANOVA for regional growth significance
5. Predictive Modeling - Exponential growth projections (2026-2030)
6. Geospatial Visualization - Thematic mapping with actual area labels 


Key Findings
•	Transilvania: 7,128k ha (Primary forest region, 47% of national total)

•	Muntenia & Oltenia: 4,991k ha combined (Significant secondary forest zones)

•	Dobrogea & Banat: 708k ha combined (Regions requiring conservation focus)


Growth Analysis
•	Highest Growth: Transilvania (+0.223% annually) and Banat (+0.209%)
•	Stagnant Regions: Bucovina (+0.00186%) showing minimal change
•	Concerning Trend: Maramureș (-0.0372%) experiencing net deforestation
•	Statistical Insight: ANOVA (p=0.155) confirms no significant regional growth differences

Projections to 2030
•	Transilvania expected to grow from 7,602k to 7,791k ha
•	Maramureș projected to decline further to 770k ha
•	Overall stable but minimal growth pattern continuing nationally
