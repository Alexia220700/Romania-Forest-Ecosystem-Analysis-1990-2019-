# Romanian Forest and Bear Conflict Analysis (1990 - 2019)

📊 Project Overview
A comprehensive data analysis project examining the relationship between forest growth patterns and bear-human conflicts in Romania from 1990 to 2019. This tool provides evidence-based insights for policymakers, conservationists, and local communities to develop balanced strategies for wildlife conservation and human livelihood protection.

## Key Features

Forest Growth Analysis: Regional growth rates and trends across 9 historical regions

Conflict Mapping: Identification of bear-human conflict hotspots

Geospatial Visualization: Interactive maps showing forest distribution changes

Statistical Modeling: ANOVA tests and correlation analysis

Policy Recommendations: Data-driven priority regions for intervention

Automated Reporting: Comprehensive PDF and text report generation/n



## Quick Start Guide & Prerequisites  
R 4.0+ installed on your system  
RStudio (recommended) for easier execution  
Required R packages: dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, maps
